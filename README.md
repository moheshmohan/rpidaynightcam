# Raspberry Pi - Day, Night NOIR Camera (Modified version)

## What is it?

This project represents a modified version of craig's simple Python script that will take pictures
using a Raspberry PI camera module. The main difference between this 
script and the `raspistill` command is that it will turn the red LED
off before taking pictures, and can automatically detect when to 
switch between user specified night and day mode settings.
